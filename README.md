## Side Panel

The Side Panel can be opened by the Ribbon Icon on the left side. If you changed the side of the panel in the settings, just hit this butten/icon again and it will reload on the right side.

## Command Language

With the command language the speed of the workflow can be specifically improved. By typing the trigger char (by default `\`) the commands will be activated and a suggestion window opens. It shows maximal 5 suggestions, which can be improved by adding more letters. The selected suggestion can be changed with the arrow keys and be activated with the enter key.
